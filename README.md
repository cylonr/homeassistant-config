# homeassistant-config
This is my configuration of Home Assistant. It may serve as a cookbook from which recipes can be taken.

It is a package based configuration. The configuration is grouped into packages that can be easily reused. In any case, you'll need to adapt the configuration to suit your needs and the name of your sensors and objects.

Scripts and configuration applied to other devices is also included, like the configuration of my laptop to work with Home Assistant.
